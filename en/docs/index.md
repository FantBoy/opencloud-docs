# AIOT Open Cloud Platform Introduction


## **Platform Introduction**

As part of the Xiaomi supply chain, Lumi has introduced several pieces of smart hardware, such as, multifunction kits, smart plug, air conditioning controller and more. It has achieved good sales numberson the Mijia platform due to its high quality and competitive prices. To further satisfy the needs of service businesses and corporate clients, Lumi has launched their own brand, Aqara, at the end of 2016. Aqara has a more robust product line, coupled with self developed cloud based control and mobile application, it is more suitable for smart homes and other Internet of things applications.

AIOT is the cloud based control behind Aqara’s productline. It is responsible for communications, control, automated settingmanagement between devices. To support third party companies researching Internet of things applications, Lumi built the AIOT open cloud platform in 2017. The platform shares data publicly, helping companies quickly join the internet of things and promoting complete smart home service upgrades.

The AIOT open cloud platform will always uphold the ideals of “Open, Altruistic, Win-Win”.  The platform provides full life cycle technical service for third party companies, accelerating the development of IoT applications, reducing construction and operating costs and helping companies to make data their core value. Currently, over 100 companies have registered on the AIOT open cloud platform; covering smart homes, smart hotels, new energy sources, firefighting, education and several other fields.

## **Data open service**

Currently, the AIOT open cloud platform provides two types of data open method. Developers can choose the appropriate method depending on their needs.

- **Cloud connection method**

The AIOT open cloud platform provides HTTP, API for remote calls from third party applications, enabling user queries, device status inquiries, and remote control devices. In addition, through the message push service, the AIOT open cloud platform pushes the real-time data uploaded by the device to a third-party server. Cloud services are easy and quick to connect with and is cheap to develop; a server is all that is required. Please refer to the “[Cloud Development Manual](http://docs.opencloud.aqara.com/en/development/cloud-development/)” for detailed information.

- **LAN connection method**

Aqara Hub supports LAN connections. After enabling this function,  developers can search for Zigbee devices (sensors, controllers, etc) through LAN connections. Compared to HTTP connections, LAN networks are faster; reducing control lag. However, development costs using LAN networks are higher and requires a third party developer Hub. Furthermore, the developer must have embedded development experience. For detailed connection methods, please see “[Gateway LAN communication protocol](http://docs.opencloud.aqara.com/en/development/gateway-LAN-communication/)”.
